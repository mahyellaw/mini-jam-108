## Project Summary. 📝

"One Stop, One Shop" is my game jam entry for Mini Jam 108(a game hackathon with a 72-hour timeframe), with the theme of **_Seaside_** and a limitaion of **_"Everything dies in one hit."_** The overall concept of this game was that the core mechanics are associated to 1; one shop can be built at a time, score values decrement and increment by 1, you get the point.
